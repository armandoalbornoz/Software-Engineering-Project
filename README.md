# BMI Tracker Codebase Overview

This README provides an overview of the structure and content of the BMI Tracker codebase.

## Project Content Structure

The BMI Tracker codebase is organized into two main directories,
each is responsible for different parts of the application.

1. `client`
2. `server`

## Project Content Overview

Client:
- The frontend of the application is built using React.js

- Components are organized under the `src/components` directory. 

- Context providers and custom hooks are used for managing application state and logic.

Server: 
- The backend is implemented using Node.js and Express.js framework. 

- Middleware functions handle incoming requests. 

- Data models and routes define the structure and behavior of the API.

Will add more tomorrow. TBA
